Unlike traditional detection methods that involve multiple passes through an image pyramid or sliding window approaches, 
YOLO V1 frames object detection as a single regression problem. It divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding 
boxes and class probabilities directly from the grid cells, offering remarkable speed and efficiency. Despite its simplicity, 
YOLO V1 achieved competitive accuracy while significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of speed, making it a landmark 
contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision. This repo has implemented this model in TensorFlow.
